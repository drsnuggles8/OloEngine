1. get rid of that unordered map in shader, see comments on video #45

2. rework that Instrumentor. could probably use jthread from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKwkpe8jmGo and combine it with https://gist.github.com/TheCherno/31f135eea6ee729ab5f26a6908eb3a5e (plus their derivatives)

3. Renderer2D wants to be cleaned up, fuck that NEW shit
- wrap those s_Data assignments into a capturing lambda (s_Data) or inline member function and add parameters for QuadVertexPosition Index, texcoord and position (video on draw rotated quads)
- glm::translate( glm::mat4(1.0f), glm::vec3(x, y, z) ) is equivalent to glm::translate(glm::vec3(x, y, z))

4. Modernize to C++20:
- Stop using preprocessor macros (OLO_BIND_EVENT_FN), function templates / overloaded C++ functions are way cooler
- replace #include with imports?

5. assert() is for detecting programming errors, use exceptions to handle runtime errors

6. fix all those CppCheck and PVS Studio and Visual Studio warnings and notices

7. In general, check what dependencies we use, and which version..I kinda want this to be automatically written down somewhere so I know which version

8. Compare the OpenGL examples with our implementation

9. Once we've added all the stuff, go through all the old videos and check comments for possible improvements

10. Swap to cmake instead of premake
i) First step, check what already has a CMakeLists.txt file:
- Sandbox: No
- Olo-Editor: No
- OloEngine: No
- entt: No, but it's header-only, should be fine
- Glad: No, has premake that we probably need to convert? Not exactly sure, look into it
- GLFW: Yes
- GLM: Yes
- ImGui: No, has a premake that we probably need to convert?
- ryml: Yes
- spdlog: Yes
- stb_image: No, but it's header-only, should be fine

11. Change how the Serializer works in two ways:
i) Replace yaml-cpp with rapidyaml (or cereal?) to improve speed
ii) Use reflection principles so we don't have to copy-paste all this shit for every damn entity, this ain't future proof
