1. Set up Jenkins pipeline properly..at the moment it's just a freestyle project:
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46083789/how-to-use-the-jenkins-msbuild-plug-in-in-a-jenkinsfile
- https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-examples/blob/master/jenkinsfile-examples/msbuild/Jenkinsfile
- https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/

"C:\Program Files (x86)\PVS-Studio\PVS-Studio_Cmd.exe" -t "OloEngine.sln" -S "OloEngine;Sandbox" -o "Logs/OloEngine.plog" fails..monkaHmm
"C:\Program Files (x86)\PVS-Studio\PlogConverter.exe" Logs/OloEngine.plog -t Html -o Logs

Don't think I want to swap to github actions since it's limited in build minutes?
probably need to add the cmake shit at the start once that's working
Other stuff to add:
- coverity scan
- cppclean
- cppdepend
- change the setup of msvc static analyzer?
- OCLint
- Flint / Flint++
- IKOS
- Valgrind
- DrMemory
- Codecov
- Coveralls
- LCOV
- kcov



2. Set up testing
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
-
