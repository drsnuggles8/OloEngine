# OloEngine

OloEngine is primarily an early-stage interactive application and rendering engine for Windows based on [Hazel](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel/) 

## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2022 is recommended, OloEngine is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/drsnuggles8/OloEngine`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!

## The Plan
The plan for OloEngine is to create a powerful 3D engine by following the Hazel videos, and then implementing our own desired features.

### Main features to come:
- Fast 2D rendering (UI, particles, sprites, etc.)
- High-fidelity Physically-Based 3D rendering (this will be expanded later, 2D to come first)
- Native rendering API support (DirectX, Vulkan)
- Fully featured viewer and editor applications
- Fully scripted interaction and behavior
- Integrated 3rd party 2D and 3D physics engine
- Procedural terrain and world generation
- Artificial Intelligence
- Audio system
